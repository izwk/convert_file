# convert_file

Just another utility for converting files written in Rust.

## Why does this exist exactly?

Got super bored. Created this out of boredom.

Also this actually converts files rather than just rename the file extension, which is what most casual users do when it comes to converting from png to jpg. Little do they know that changing the file extension doesn't change the file format. lol...

## What features does this "utility" currently support?

Supports image conversions currently. Will add support for more types of file conversions soon.

## How to use?

Examples of how to use:

    $ convert_file img test.jpg test.png
    $ convert_file img test.png test.jpg
